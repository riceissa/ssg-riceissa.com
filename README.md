# a static site generator

For now this is mostly just to play around with the JSON output from pandoc, and to learn how to write filters for pandoc (with pandocfilters).

eventually this may replace hakyll for generating html pages on my [personal site](http://riceissa.com).

## to do

- implement pandoc compilation code again
- tags?
- rss?
- sitemap?
- support for gitit-like internal linking?
- jinja templates?
